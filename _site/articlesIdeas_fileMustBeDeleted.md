### 1 week for research:
* Workarounds: Intercept methods calls of @EJB bean injected using RMI.
* Complex method project OOP structure. Class per Method.(extend method, utils, whereIAm, and features such as that). Different variations. FUIB projects such as IB2, ibanking can help me. Plus, don't forget about Spring and it's patterns, and even better to find sth about that in any Spring patterns book.
* A detailed comparison between SSL and WS-Security
* Understanding of distribution chat algorithms (mb usefull -- http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jweisz/courses/docs/weisz06_ChatClassification.pdf)
* Jmeter and Selenium integration. Not really interesting topic, it's close to removing;
* Compare describing WS by Swagger vs SOAP Scecification(and do not forget to mention WADL). 
### 2 weeks for research(in parallel with one 4-weeks-research):
* Hello world example for microservices architecture in Kubernetes(Python**, Node.js**, Java**, Scala )
* Auth2 example in microservices architecture with Kubernetes and (Python**, Node.js**, Java**, Scala and so own)
* 
### 4 weeks for research(in parallel with other researches):
* Comparing API and Functionality of Hazelcast and Terracotta
* Compare Postgres noSQL and Mongo DB. (quary, functionality, speed, scalability, transactions(+ levels)). OR maybe just postgres nosql overview. And I can compare Postgres nosql with another nosql db.
* Sessions in cluster environment(AS clustering, containers, connection between them, JVM tool as Spring Sessions). To continue such topic I can find out ways to manage session in Python,Ruby,Node.js environments.
